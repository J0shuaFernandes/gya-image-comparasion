# gya-image-comparasion
 
## Objectives
- develop a high-performance FastAPI application capable of comparaing images
- allow users to upload two images that are to be compared
- result should indicate whether the two images are "matching" or "not matching"
- it should be able to tell whether the two images are a match regardless of whether or not they're of the same size

## Method
Since it is stated that the script should disregard the size of the two images while compararing them. The method that I have used is Scale-Invariant Feature Transform.


### RGB Tests
Test1: Images of Two Different Products
Test2: Same Product Same Dimensions but Compressed
